# Team-Profile-Display

## Description

- My motivation for this project is to create an interactive application in the command line to allow a manager to fill out a Team Profile to access information quicker
- I built this project because it will help organize information on employees for any employer
- This application saves time looking for additional information on employees, comprising it all on one page to later reference 
- I learned how to write to a html file and use inquirer packages to write and output code
